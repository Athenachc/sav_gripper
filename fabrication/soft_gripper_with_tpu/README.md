# Soft gripper *with* inextensible layers
## Mould
All the components of the mould can be fabricated by 3D printing. 

The inextensible layers are made of Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) with a shore hardness of 80 A. They are also fabricated by 3D printing.

Please feel free to download the STL files here: [Moulds_gripper_tpu.zip](/fabrication/soft_gripper_with_tpu/Moulds_gripper_tpu.zip)  

For the details of the application of this soft gripper, please see this preprint: [Aerial Grasping with Soft Aerial Vehicle Using Disturbance Observer-Based Model Predictive Control

## Fabrication
The manufacturing process of this soft gripper with the inextensible layers is similar to the [previous](/fabrication/soft_gripper_without_tpu/README.md) steps.

Additional steps are shown as follows:
1. Adhere an inextensible layer on the back of the soft finger.
2. Adhere the back of the soft finger to its main body and cover.

*Only the mould used to make the air chamber is disposable because it will be twisted and bent during removal from the soft finger.

*The back, cover, and main body of the soft finger can be aligned by assembling the moulds. The assembly is shown below.
