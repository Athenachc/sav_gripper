## Fabrication
1. Spray the resin mould release on the mould, which is depicted in the middle of (a), wrapped in liquid silicone rubber to make an air chamber in the main body. Hence, this mould can be removed easily after curing. 
2. Assemble the moulds for the main body and cover the soft finger. 
3. Pour the liquid silicone rubber into the moulds for the main body and cover separately. 
4. Cut a small hole on each finger's cover after the silicone rubber finishes curing inside the moulds. This allows a silicone tube (OD = 4mm; ID = 2mm) to pass through the cover.
5. Adhere the silicone tube and the cover with resin glue. 
6. Adhere the main body and the cover with the silicone tube with resin glue.

*Only the mould used to make the air chamber is disposable because it will be twisted and bent during removal from the soft finger.
