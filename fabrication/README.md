# Fabrication 
## Silicone Rubber Preparation
1. Combine equal amounts (e.g., 25 g each) of liquid parts A and B of Smooth-On Dragon Skin 30 (Pot life: 45 min; Cure time: 16 hrs).
2. Mix the liquid rubber thoroughly for at least 3 minutes, ensuring you scrape the sides and bottom of the mixing container.
3. Perform [debubbling](#debubbling-steps) using a vacuum pressure of -0.1 MPa with a vacuum barrel of 20 cm diameter and a 4-L vacuum pump.
4. Your rubber mixture is now ready to be poured or injected into the mould.

## Debubbling steps
1. Put the container with well-mixed rubber into the vacuum barrel.
2. Make sure the barrel is tightly sealed by opening and closing the correct valve(s).
3. Turn on the vacuum pump for at least 5 minutes. Stop it when you see only a few bubbles (usually 1â€“3) gently floating to the surface of the rubber.
4. Remove the cover of the barrel by opening and closing the correct valve(s).
5. Take out the rubber container and prepare to pour or inject the rubber into the mould.
