# Fabrication 
## Silicone Rubber Preparation
1. Combine equal amounts (e.g. 25 g) of liquid parts A and B of Smooth-on Dragon Skin 30 (Pot life: 45 min; Cure Time: 16 hrs).
2. Mix the liquid rubber contents thoroughly. It is better to mix them for 3 minutes to ensure that you scrape the sides and bottom of the mixing container.
3. Do Deubbling (Vacuum pressure: -0.1 MPa; diameter of the vacuum barrel: 20 cm; 4-L vacuum pump). 
4. Then your rubber mixture is ready to be poured or injected into the mould.

## Debbling steps
1. Put the rubber container with well-mixed rubber into the vacuum barrel.
2. Ensure the barrel is covered tightly by opening/closing the correct valve(s).
3. Turn on the vacuum pump for at least 5 min. Stop it until you can see only a few bubbles (usually 1-3) gently float up on the rubber surface.
4. Take off the cover of the barrel by opening/closing the correct valve(s).
5. Take out your rubber container and get ready to pour or inject the rubber to the mould.
