# sav_gripper
This project regulates the soft gripper's pressure and employs a feed-forward proportional control strategy. Notably, the feed-forward proportional control only sets the PWM signal for the air pump. At the same time, the PWM command of the flight controller directly determines the digital signals for activating solenoid valves.
